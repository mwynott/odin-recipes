    This simple project aims to create a simple
    recipe site using HTML. CSS/JavaScript will not
    be used here. Instead, this is a test of the
    simple use of HTML to create a website with
    relative links, images, etc. Once the project is
    complete, I will have used all of the tools
    available to me through TOP in its construction.
    There website is very simple: just a homepage with links to various
    recipes, including step-by-step instructions
    and images.
