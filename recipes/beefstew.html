    <h2>What is beef stew?</h2>
    Beef stew is a cold weather stew containing stew beef
    as well as carrots, onions, potatos, peas, and other root 
    vegetables in a thick, hearty broth.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs stewing beef, trimmed and cubed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion chopped</li>
        <li>6 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 lb potatos, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>4 carrots cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 ribs celery cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
             Toss beef in flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high
             heat. Shake off any excess flour from the beef and brown in 
             small batches. Remove and set aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the onions to the pot, adding more oil as needed, and cook
             until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth and red wine while scraping up any brown bits
             in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir in browned beef, potatoes, carrots, celery, tomato paste, 
            and rosemary. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour 
            or until beef is tender (up to 90 minutes).</li>
        <li>Mix equal parts cornstarch and water to create a slurry. Slowly 
            add the slurry to the boiling stew to reach desired consistency 
            (you may not need all of the slurry, if you'd like a thicker stew, 
            you can add extra).  </li>
        <li>Stir in peas and simmer 5-10 minutes before serving . Season with 
            salt & pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
