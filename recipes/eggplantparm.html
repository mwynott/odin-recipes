        <li>2 medium to large eggplants</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, or 4 smaller eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil (for fired eggplant method)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Homemade Breadcrumbs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 bread slices (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese (shredded)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (each) salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups marinara</li>
        <li>1 lb mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup parmesan cheese (shredded)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons fresh basil (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano (chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice eggplant: remove stem from eggplant then slice into 1/4-1/2 inch thick slices.</li>
        <li>Sweat eggplant: arrange slices on a pan and sprinkle with a pinch of coarse salt on 
            both sides. Let sit and "sweat" excess moisture for 10 minutes. Pat firmly with paper 
            towels to dry eggplant thoroughly (wipe off salt as well).</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs: toast slices of bread. Then chop in food processor until consistency is 
            crumbs. Mix breadcrumbs in a bowl with garlic powder, salt & pepper, Italian herbs, 
            and shredded parmesan cheese. Tip: If you are not making your own breadcrumbs, use 1 1/2 
            cups of store-bought breadcrumbs instead.</li>
        <li>Bread eggplant: arrange three bowls containing whisked eggs, flour, and breadcrumb mixture.
            First, coat eggplant in flour on both sides, then dip into eggs, and then dip into breadcrumbs - 
            pack onto eggplant and then gently shake off excess crumbs. Wipe hands with paper towel then 
            repeat. Tip: if baking eggplant instead of frying, brush a sheet pan with 1-2 Tablespoons
             of oil and arrange breaded eggplant onto pan as you coat them.</li>
        <li>Pan frying method: in a skillet pan, add 1-2 Tablespoons of oil at a time, and cook breaded 
            eggplant for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Lay on paper towels to soak up excess 
            oil. Repeat until all eggplant has been fried.</li>
        <li>Assemble: in a large casserole dish, spread a generous layer of marinara on the bottom. Then 
            layer: eggplant slices, mozzarella, a spoonful of marinara, and shredded parmesan. Repeat an 
            additional layer (breaded eggplant, mozzarella, marinara, and shredded parmesan).</li>
        <li>Bake: Then bake at 400F uncovered for 30 minutes until cheese is browned and melted. Top with 
            chopped fresh basil & oregano, and serve!</li>
    </ol>
