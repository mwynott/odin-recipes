    <h2>What is macaroni & cheese?</h2>
    Simply put, macaroni & cheese is a baked pasta dish that uses
    a cream based cheese sauce to give it that signature gooey 
    consistency. It is a staple comfort food in America.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk, any kind</li>
        <li>3/4 cup half and half</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F and lightly grease 
            an 8' square (or similar size) baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cook the macaroni to al dente, according to package 
            instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan 
                over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. 
                Cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add the milk and half and half, 
                stirring constantly, and cook over medium-low heat for a 
                few minutes until the mixture has thickened like the 
                consistency of gravy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat
                 and stir in 1 cup shredded cheese, stirring just until 
                 melted.</li>
            <li>Combine: Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat. 
                Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. 
                Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Add remaining pasta and
                 sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted on top.</li>
